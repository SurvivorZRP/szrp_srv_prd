	Important : don't modify the variable names and don't use these names in comments if you write some. 	
	
	The modifications you will do should not be crushed when new variables will come with new updates.
	So don't worry you shouldn't lose your tweaks with updates (but keep reading the patch notes to be sure!).

	Section "NewFeatures" (at the end of the file)
		In this section you will find the new features variables.
		
		You can move these variables in an existing sections.
		It is not mandatory but more clear for you to tweak in the future.		

////////////////////////
		
	Customisable_Zombies_List
		You can change the name of the file containing zombie characteristics
		This is useful to quickly change the zombie configuration or to make tests
		Don't forget .xml extension

	Features_Activation	
		Disable_All_Features
			This will disable all feature of the mod
			Useful if you encounter problems (but it shouldn't happen ;-))
		Zombies_Health_Activated / Zombies_Resistance_Activated / Zombies_Speed_Activated / Zombies_Vision_Activated...
			This disable the feature one by one
			It is the more efficient way to disable a feature (more that modify characteristics) 
			All my code will be skipped so no bug or resource consume from a disabled feature that way
		
////////////////////////	

	Zombies_Caracteristics :
	
		Zombies_Health_Ratio		
			Ratio (%) applied to all zombies health
			
		Zombies_Strength_Ratio
			Ratio (%) applied to all zombies 
				Ratio_Damage_Health
				Ratio_Damage_Shock
				Damage_Blood
				Damage_Stamina
				(!NOT to the Bleeding_Chance!)
				
		Zombies_Speed_Ratio	
			Ratio (%) applied to all zombies minimum and maximum speed		

////////////////////////	

	Players_Caracteristics
		Maximum_Number_Of_Bleeding_Sources_From_Zombies_Combat
			It is the maximum number of bleeding source from zombie
			It does not include bleeding from ladders or ruined shoes
			
		Shoes_Degradation_When_Hit_By_Crawling_Zombie
			The crawling zombies inflict damages to player shoes 
			Increase it if you want make things harder
	
		The "Gloves" values intend to avoid players to fight zombies with fists too easily
		Gloves_Degradation_Speed_When_Fist_Fighting
			Increase it if you want make things harder
		Bleeding_Chance_If_Fist_Fighting_Without_Gloves
			Increase it if you want make things harder
		Player_Dammage_If_Fist_Fighting_Without_Gloves
			Increase it if you want make things harder
		Player_Health_Limite_To_Take_Dammage_From_Fist_Fighting
			This limit is because nobody want to die because a wound at the hand
			Default value is 80 (maximum health is 100)
			Decrease it if you want make things harder

		Special_Mask_To_Hide_From_Zombies
			It is a list of mask that allow player to modify zombie vision.
			When a player wear one of this mask, the "WithSpecialMask" ratio from Characteristics file is apply to zombies vision distance.

	Important :
		The fist class corresponding to the spawned zombie is used
		For example if you place "ZmbM_HermitSkinny_Base" before "ZmbM_HermitSkinny_Black"
		the "_Base" values will be used because "ZmbM_HermitSkinny_Base" is the parent of "ZmbM_HermitSkinny_Black" 
		
		"ZombieBase" is the "grandparent" class of all zombies, that's why it is at the end of the file		
		If you want to add NEW ZOMBIE TYPES (from other mods), add the new categorie at BEGINING OF THE LIST	
		If you want all zombies to have exactly same characteristics, you can modify "ZombieBase" as you want and delete all other categories.
		
////////////////////////
	
	type name :
		The name of the class of the zombie
		Note that the mod does not work for animals
	
	Health_Points : 
		The number of heath point of the zombie

	Resistance_to_Bullets /  Melees / Vehicles / Explosions / HeadShots	:	
		Inferior to 1 	: Weak from damages
		1 				: Normal resistance to damages 
		Superior to 1 	: More resistant to damages

	Move_Speed_Min / Max : 
		1.0 - 1.6 : Walk 			 
		2.2 - 2.7 : run 				
		2.8 - 3.0 : sprint 
		(1.7-2.1 : sometime walk, sometime run, not recommended to use)
	
	Chance_To_Spawn_Crawling : 
		-1 	: Never Crawling even when been shooted in legs
		0  	: Never spawned Crawling 			 
		0.5	: 50% chance to spawn Crawling 	
		1 	: Always spawn Crawling
	
	/////////
	
	Health_Points / Restistances / Chance_To_Spawn_Crawling / MoveSpeeds : 
		First Value  : DAY 	 time value
		Second Value : NIGHT time value

////////////////////////

	Ratio_Damage_Health / Ratio_Damage_Shock :
		RATIO applied to the vanilla "Heath"/"Shock" damages deals by zombies
		Keep in mind it is a RATIO (%) not a quantity
	
	Bleeding_Chance :
		Chance (%) for the player to bleed when hit by the zombie
		Note that you can let the vanilla system dealing the bleeding chance by setting the value to -1
		The vanilla bleeding chance are 10% for all attacks types
	
	Damage_Blood :
		QUANTITY of blood the player loose when hit by the zombie
		The player have a maximum of 5000 blood 
		Keep in mind that the player can die with when than 2500 depending on his other statutes 
		the vanilla system is not very clear about that so be careful
		Note that the vanilla system does not apply blood damage on zombie hits
		Keep in mind it is a QUANTITY not a ratio

	Damage_Stamina
		QUANTITY of stamina that the player loose when hit by the zombie
		This is not a permanent stamina lose, the player recover it as usual
		The maximum stamina is 100 (when carrying nothing)
		Note that the vanilla system does not apply stamina and blood damage on zombie hits
		Keep in mind it is a QUANTITY not a ratio
		
	/////////
	
	LightAttack_NotBlocked
		Value (ratio or quantity) applied when zombie perform a LIGHT attack and the player does NOT BLOCK it
	
	LightAttack_Blocked
		Value (ratio or quantity) applied when zombie perform a LIGHT attack and the player BLOCK it
	
	HeavyAttack_NotBlocked
		Value (ratio or quantity) applied when zombie perform a HEAVY attack and the player does NOT BLOCK it
	
	HeavyAttack_Blocked
		Value (ratio or quantity) applied when zombie perform a HEAVY attack and the player BLOCK it
	
	NightRatio
		Ratio applied to the previous chosen ratio or quantity
	
	
	Exemple : 		
		If zombie perform a heavy attack on a player that block it, during the night.
		Damage applied = 
			Vanilla Heavy Attack damage (with vanilla clothing protection factor applied)
			* HeavyAttack_Blocked ratio
			* NightRatio
			* Zombies_Strength_Ratio Night (from PvZmoD_CustomisableZombies_Globals.xml file)
			
////////////////////////

	Vision_Distance_Ratios :
		It is ratios applied to vanilla vision distance of zombies
		The ratio are cumulative
		
	Example of vision distance calculation :
		Final vision distance = 
			Default Vanilla vision distance 
			* Vanilla night ratio	(yes there is already a vanilla night ratio so don't lower the one of PvZ too much or zombie will become blind)
			* Vanilla vision modifiers (include player stance, speed, and clothes)
			* PvZ Day or Night ratio
			* PvZ WithBloodyHands ratio (if player have bloody hands)
			* PvZ WithSpecialMask ratio (if player wear a special mask that is in the Global.xml file)
			
	Note1 : The result of le multiplication of the 3 PvZ ratios can't be inferior to the "MiniMumRatioDistance" value (to avoid being able to go too close to the zombies)
	Note2 : The Zombies hearing is not affected so zombies can be attracted by player sounds but will not aggro if they are not close enough.
	Note3 : If you choose to increase the ratio beyond 1 to increase vision distance, the result will never exceed the original "Default Vanilla vision distance"

	/////////
	
	What means "-99" :
		You can set a characteristic to "-99" if you want to use the "ZombieBase" corresponding value.
		It is useful for change value of many zombie at the same time.
		I hesitated to set all non modified values to -99 but I thought it will not be clear for users.		
	
////////////////////////

	You can find a couple of examples at the end of the xml file (before "ZombieBase" class of course)
	
		Example_VANILLA_Config_for_VANILLA_Zombies
			Use it if you want to keep vanilla zombies characteristics
			
		Example_OTHER_MOD_Zombies_whith_their_VANILLA_Config
			Use it if you want add new zombies from other mods and keep the health points form the mod
			The important value is the Health_Points = 100000; (don't wory it will not really set health to 100000)
			
		Example_USE_DEFAULT_Config_values
			All the values are set to "-99" so the "ZombieBase" values are used
			Useful to tweak lot of zombies at once
		
		Example_WALKINGDEAD_HeadShot
			And finally a Walking Dead zombie because I know a lot of you like it.
			Note that the night values are "normal zombies" ones to compare differences between walking dead and vanilla zombies
			Tips : if you want all zombies be the exactly same walking dead, you can copy the walking dead characteristics in "ZombieBase" and delete all other categories.
